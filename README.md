# Pong
a C++ game which uses the embedded system and OpenCV for graphics

inheriting from the Base4618 class as in the last lab. The pong update method will read the user input (vertical analog joystick) and compute the paddle positions, ball position and check for collisions. If a collision occurs the corresponding action can be determined (bounce, score, etc). The draw method should handle rendering the output image (paddles, ball and score) and displaying the imageon the screen
